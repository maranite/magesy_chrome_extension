This is an extension for Google Chrome which targets the Magesy audio web site.
In short, the extension does 3 things:

1. Eliminates annoying antics like drive-by popup ads, anti-adblockplus scripts, tracking scripts, etc.
2. Cleans up the layout slightly so that annying side-bars and headers are hidden.
3. Auto-fetches links from beelink.in and brings them into the Magesy page. 
   This eliminates the need to visit beelink.in and sit through all of it's respective popups, anti-adblock scripts, etc.
